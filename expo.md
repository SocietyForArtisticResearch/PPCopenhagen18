# RC Exposition

* Publication format and a authoring framework (editor)
* Technology of reading and writing
* Allow for ways of experiencing, developing and documenting artistic research
* Exposition editor as a research tool
* Untapped potential

# RC Exposition as a Digital Object

* Links human authoring and consumption with machine processing
* A dynamic creator of techno-aesthetic relations 
* Different milieux: aesthetic, political, technological and social context
* Can be processes, programmed, transformed and linked and extended

<!-- the inner composition of graphical expositions still -->
<!-- remains opaque to machines, which hampers adaptability and long-term archiving. -->

# Challenge 1: Sketching and Publishing

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Stability, persistence and referencability have been prioritised</li>
<li class="fragment">Hampers drafting and sketching</li>
<li class="fragment">A text cannot exist without a width, height and position</li>
<li class="fragment">Productiveness of the indeterminate in experimental practices</li>
<li class="fragment">Accommodate the tentative and fragmentary</li>
</ul>

# Challenge 2: Absolute Positioning

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Fixedness of the exposition format stands in contrast to HTML and web technologies</li>
<li class="fragment">Inherited the ideal of static appearance from print publishing</li>
<li class="fragment">Technologies and ways of reading are constantly evolving</li>
<li class="fragment">Rethink the role of the author, dynamic potential should be embraced</li>
</ul>


# Challenge 3: Dominance of the Visual

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Design of an exposition is almost exclusively visual</li>
<li class="fragment">Proximity, size, pathways, topography are vital to the meaning of an exposition</li>
<li class="fragment">We should seek sonorous, textual, temporal etc. ways of structuring expositions</li>
<li class="fragment">Exposition needs to be a programmable object that can be linked, rendered, stored
and converted in infinite ways</li>
</ul>

# Web Pages

<ul>
<li class="fragment">A WP is not an autonomous two-dimensional canvas, but a dynamically
changing data structure</li> 
<li class="fragment">A WP depends on a multitude of standards and services</li>
<li class="fragment">A WP interacts with servers, clients and events</li>
<li class="fragment">A WP needs to be performed by browsers</li>
</ul>

# Multiplicity

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Formal specification</li>
<li class="fragment">Multiple authoring tools</li>
<li class="fragment">Greatly enhances the long-term accessibility and digital preservation</li>
<li class="fragment">Content not tied to a single format or implementation</li>
</ul>

# Adaptability

<center>
<blockquote> The control which designers know in the print medium, and
often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation
of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t
have the same constraints, and design for this
flexibility. </blockquote> (John Allsopp, "A Dao of Web Design", 2000)
</center>

# Adaptability

<ul>
<li class="fragment">Authoring as exploration of potentials</li>
<li class="fragment">Rethink the exposition as a more dynamic entity</li>
<li class="fragment">Access for people with vision impairment or hearing loss</li>
</ul>

# Programmability

<ul> 
<li class="fragment">Web pages are programmable entitites</li>
<li class="fragment">Open expositions to creative coders</li> 
<li class="fragment">Departure from WYSIWYG</li> 
<li class="fragment">Investigation of interface design and usability</li>
<li class="fragment">Exposition as a dynamic digital object that can
connect to other objects, services, technologies and humans</li> 
</ul>
